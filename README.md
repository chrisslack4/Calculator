# Overview

With this softwware my goal was to learn the basics of C++. As such throughout the code there are different ways of doing various things such as If statements, and checking responses. Though this makes for an inconsistent coding style my goal was to demonstrate the various things I learned and how someways maybe more preferable than others. The biggest trouble I had was getting C++ to run and debug in VS code. I had most my code writen before I found out where I went wrong on installing C++ as being able to be used.

This program is a basic calculator that will ask for the input of two numbers and for the math function to be done then display the answer and ask if the user want to repeat the process. It also uses error checking to check if the response given for operaters is accepable and re-asks if it is not. Lastly it also has the ablilty to save the calculations done to a file so one can refer vback to it.

The purpose of creating this software was to demonstrate the basics of C++. In this code one is able to find variables, loops, if statements, writes data to a file, and allows to run additional computations.
